After this, the excel sheet will be downloaded, according to the fields of the form, columns will be created in this excel sheet and in this columns you can insert data. If for some reason the data is not being filled in any field of the form or if a column is left, then you can also manually [create a column]({{<docsref "/excel-column/column">}}).
